This project is a simple online store built with [Astro](https://astro.build), JavaScript for the client-side scripts, TypeScript for server-side scripts, HTML5, and CSS3. This is an open-source project aiming to provide a practical and straightforward e-commerce platform.

## Project Overview

Currently, the backend of this project utilizes the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/), a free online REST API that provides fake data for e-commerce or shopping websites.

In the future, the project is set to evolve with a backend developed with Bun.js and Express.
